## You can always count on me when... 
My contribution could be in various fields. From a technical point of view, I gained experience in some areas that could possibly be useful. Furthermore, I also appreciate the idea of ​​fostering a welcoming environment where everyone is comfortable sharing their ideas.


## A funny story 
There was a pretty hilarious moment when a doctor asked me to do an X-ray of a penis for a patient. This unusual request puzzled me.

Not daring to do this delicate X-ray, I decided to consult a colleague to get her opinion. I explained the situation to him. We both agreed that this task was embarrassing to say the least. Even my colleague was not ready to embark on such an X-ray adventure. The situation was so unexpected that I wondered if it was a kind of "baptism", given that I had only recently been working in radiography.

Finally, my colleague performed an x-ray of the pelvis. However, this did not suit the doctor. Fortunately, the doctor eventually gave up the idea and settled for an ultrasound.

### Summary
Caught off guard by an unexpected request from a doctor, I found myself in a bind.
